The Object Model

1. How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an object.

Solution
We create an object by defining a class and instantiating it by using the .new method to create an instance,
also known as an object.

class MyClass
end

my_obj = MyClass.new

2. What is a module? What is its purpose? How do we use them with our classes? Create a module for the class 
you created in exercise 1 and include it properly.

Solution
A module allows us to group reusable code into one place. We use modules in our classes by using the include 
reserved word, followed by the module name. Modules are also used as a namespace.

module Study
end

class MyClass
  include Study
end

my_obj = MyClass.new


Classes and Objects - Part I

1. class MyCar

  def initialize(year, model, color)
    @year = year
    @model = model
    @color = color
    @current_speed = 0
  end

  def speed_up(number)
    @current_speed += number
    puts "You push the gas and accelerate #{number} mph."
  end

  def brake(number)
    @current_speed -= number
    puts "You push the brake and decelerate #{number} mph."
  end

  def current_speed
    puts "You are now going #{@current_speed} mph."
  end

  def shut_down
    @current_speed = 0
    puts "Let's park this bad boy!"
  end
end

lumina = MyCar.new(1997, 'chevy lumina', 'white')
lumina.speed_up(20)
lumina.current_speed
lumina.speed_up(20)
lumina.current_speed
lumina.brake(20)
lumina.current_speed
lumina.brake(20)
lumina.current_speed
lumina.shut_down
lumina.current_speed
